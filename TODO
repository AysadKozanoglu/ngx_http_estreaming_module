1. Android devices still have great problem with hls, and dash also. What could be the problem should be figured out? 
2. Adaptive streaming using on-the-fly transcoding is nice function, but it uses too much cpu resources, what should we do to improve speed with less cpu resouce usage?
3. Add new function to not to use transcoding but still support adaptive bitrate (implement already)
